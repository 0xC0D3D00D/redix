    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core
    # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the
    # software. Run the test with `brew test redix`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.
